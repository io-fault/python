# internet is a project providing tools for working with DNS, HTTP, and SMTP.
# It is implemented with event driven operation in mind, but does not
# include any code for actually performing any communication; it merely structures
# data read from a Wire and serializes data that is to be sent to the Wire. It
# is intended to be a dependency of frameworks, applications, or servers that are
# implementing support for HTTP or DNS.
