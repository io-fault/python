[ Employed Models ]

fault.io is arguably an implementation of the actor model. However, it adheres
to no formalities. Most of the interest revolves around &.core.Transaction's
and their associated &.core.Context. More generic classes exist for classification
purposes and to handle some edge cases such as anonymous Transactions where the Context
is implicit.

[ Fundamental Types ]

There are a number of important types introduced by fault.io: Resource, Transformer, Processor,
Flow, and Sector. Sectors are subclassed from Processor, but considered somewhat distinct
in that it is the primary grouping type. Sectors are dependent on the Processors that are
subresources of the Sector; subresources being resources contained by the Sector.

The &.core.Processor is the base class for any type that is intended to persist within the
Resource hierarchy of a process.

[ Processors Exit ]

A Processor has two paths in order for an exit event to occur. Interruption and
Termination. Interruption is analogous to process interrupt signals on unix and
termination is the conflation between [natural] completion and administrative
termination.

All Processors must support Interrupts, but external termination does not
have to be supported. The distinction is that external termination may not always
be appropriate for a Processor; it may not have the ability to close out
the event stream in a safe manner.

Connections, for instance, are primarily interrupted rather than terminated.
Termination tends to only occur naturally by protocol events. Administrative
termination may be supported by some protocols, but it can only be achieved at
certain break points and may end up looking like an interrupt anyways.

Termination: The completion of the terminal event; the final state possible.
Interruption: The destruction

Sectors naturally contain interruptions/exceptions; exiting normally, but noting
that it was interrupted.

[ Context Parameters ]

Context processors being a focal point of io applications have multiple sources for
parameters. These parameters are classified in order to differentiate.

/Requisite Parameters/
	Parameters usually given to (python/method)`__init__`. These parameters
	are implementation specific and are normally (term)`locally defined`.

/Environment Parameters/
	Parameters inherited by the supercontext.

/Configured Parameters/
	Parameters that are *not* defined within the implementation. Usually structured
	in a way that can be modified dynamically.
