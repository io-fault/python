"""
Root process for service management and scheduled processes.

libroot provides the primary support for &.bin.rootd which manages a scheduling daemon,
a set of service processes and a set of service Sectors assigned to a particular
group with its own configurable concurrency level.

Multiple instances of faultd may exist, but usually only one per-user is necessary.
The (system:directory)`$HOME/.faultd` directory is used by default, but can be adjusted by a command
line parameter. The daemon directory supplies all the necessary configuration,
so few options are available from system invocation.

It is important that the faultd directory exist on the same partition as the
Python executable. Hardlinks are used in order to provide accurate process names.

The daemon directory structure is a set of service directories managed by the instance with
"scheduled" and "root" reserved for the management of the administrative scheduler
and the spawning daemon itself.

/root/
	Created automatically to represent the faultd process.
	All files are instantiated as if it were a regular service.
	state is always ON
	invocation.xml written every boot to reflect its invocation

/root/
	type: sectors | daemon | command | root (reserved for libroot)
	actuates: True or False (whether or not its to be spawned)
	status: run state (executed|terminated|exception)
	invocation.xml: command and environment for service
	if/: directory of sockets; 0 refers to the master
		0-n
		Only guaranteed to be available for sectord and control types.
