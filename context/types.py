	# of a sequence to know that the sequence produced in a particular case
	# will never contain more than one element without having to explicitly
	# communicate such a fact with another value sent alongside the sequence.

	# While an explicit plural field is clear and desirable, it also carries
	# the burden of having to be propagated with the sequence.
	# Having the sequence type designate the constraint allows the information
	# to be propagated without concern by the nodes along the call graph.
