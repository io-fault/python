[ Glossary ]

/Route
	A path, real or imaginary, to a concept defined by the (term)`Subject Space`.
	Routes consist of a &Context and a sequence of &Points.
	Ultimately, a Route is a mere sequence of identifiers. However, identifiers
	can be complex allowing predicates.

/Context
	The beginning of a particular Route. Contexts are used to establish an anchor
	that operations are performed relative to. Often, the context is irrelevant for many
	use-cases, but is often used as a conceptual equivalent to the
	(system/environment)`PWD`.

	Contexts can also serve user defined semantics. For instance, consider web server
	routing where the transition point between handlers needs to be recorded. A stack
	of contexts can be used to ultimately identify the points along the path in which
	one handler passed the remaining points into the next.

/Points
	A sequence of identifiers that select a concept relative to the &Context.
	Identifiers of abstract routes can be any hashable, but normally they are
	a file's basename or a module's basename.

/Subject Space
	The graph of concepts that the Route refers to.
	The Selection of a Route is said to exist within the Subject Space.

/Node
	A real object in the (term)`Subject Space`. A (term)`Route` *refers*
	to a Node. Routes consisting of identifiers independent of the
	(term)`Subject Space` may refer to Nodes that do not exist.

/Selection
	The concept identified by &Route.
	Not all Routes have Selections as &Route instances are an arbitrary
	sequence of identifiers.

/System
	The (term)`Subject Space`.
