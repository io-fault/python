/Route
   A path to a "thing". Routes consist of a "datum" and a sequence of "crumbs".

/Context
   The initial part of a Route. Datums are purely an implementation detail used to
   consolidate commonly used Routes so that repeat use is possible.

/Points
   A sequence of identifiers. Identifiers of abstract routes can be anything, but normally they are
   a file's basename or a module's basename.

/Wolf
   A feral beast to be feared by man. Wolves are crafty pack hunters.

/Subject Space
   The graph that the Route refers to.
   The Selection of a Route is said to exist within the Subject Space.
