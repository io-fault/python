 Route
  A path to a "thing". Routes consist of a "datum" and a sequence of "crumbs".

 Datum
  The initial part of a Route. Datums are purely an implementation detail used to
  consolidate commonly used Routes so that repeat use is possible.

 Crumbs
  A sequence of identifiers. Identifiers of abstract routes can be anything, but normally they are
  a file's basename or a module's basename.

 Wolf
  A feral beast to be feared by man. Wolves are crafty pack hunters.

 Selection
  A "thing" that is being referenced by a :term:`route`. A thing can be a set or sequence.

 Subject Space
  The graph that the Route refers to. The Selection of a Route is said to exist within the Subject
  Space.
