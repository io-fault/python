[ Overview ]
============

Units of unbound quantities of time are called "eternals". They are a special Measure and
Point type that have only three values: zero, infinity, and negative infinity.

Time classes are created by Time Contexts. The default context is
initialized and provided by the &.types module. The following
lists are the time classes created by that context.

Point In Time types:

	- &.types.Timestamp
	- &.types.Date
	- &.types.Week
	- &.types.GregorianMonth

Measure types:

	- &.types.Measure
	- &.types.Days
	- &.types.Weeks
	- &.types.Months

The interfaces are described by the abstract base classes in
&.abstract. Primarily:

/&.abstract.Time/
	A measure or point. The common abstract base class.

/&.abstract.Measure/
	A measurement of time.

/&.abstract.Point/
	A point in time. Points are used to specify calendar dates or
	calendar dates with time of day.

[ Eccentricities ]
------------------

[> Points and Measures are Python Integers ]

This has the effect that integers with the same value will be seen as the same
key in dictionaries:

#!python
	>>> from fault.time import types
	>>> from fault.time import constants
	>>> d = {}
	>>> d[types.Date(0)] = 'Hello, World!'
	>>> print d[0]
	Hello, World!

If type based scoping is needed, the key can be qualified with the type:

#!python
	d = {}
	d[(types.Date, types.Date(0))] = 'date-value'
	d[(types.Timestamp, types.Timestamp(0))] = 'timestamp-value'

Or, nested dictionaries could be used:

#!python
	d = {types.Date: {}, types.Timestamp: {}}
	d[types.Date][types.Date(0))] = 'date-value'
	d[types.Timestamp][types.Timestamp(0))] = 'timestamp-value'

[> Datetime Math ]

&..time is heavily based on direct Python &int subclasses. This offers many
benefits, but it also avoids overriding the integer's operators leaving a,
contextually, low-level operation that should normally be avoided. This likely
offers a suprise as the usual addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`) operators
do not perform as they would with the standard library's &datetime.datetime
or many other datetime packages.

Instead, &..time relies on the higher-level methods to perform delta
calculation and point positioning.

[> Day and Month Fields ]

The `day` and `month` fields of the standard time context are **offsets** and
are not consistent with the usual representation of gregorian day-of-month and
month-of-year. Some of the Container keywords do, however, use the usual
gregorian representation.

More clearly:

#!python
	pit = types.Timestamp.of(iso="2002-01-01T00:00:00")
	assert pit.select('day', 'month') == 0
	assert pit.select('month', 'year') == 0

As opposed to the day-of-month and month-of-year fields being equal to `1` as
one might expect them to be. Rather, *they are offsets*.

[> Month Arithmetic Can Overflow ]

The implementation of month arithmetic is sensitive to the selected day:

#!python
	# working with a leap year
	pit = types.Timestamp.of(iso='2012-01-31T18:55:33.946259')
	pit.elapse(month=1)
	types.Timestamp.of(iso='2012-03-02T18:55:33.946259')

The issue can be avoided by adjusting the PiT to the beginning of the month:

#!python
	pit = pit.update('day', 0, 'month')
	pit.elapse(month=1)

[> Annums and Years ]

The "year" unit in &..time is strictly referring to gregorian years. This means
that a "year" in &..time is actually twelve gregorian months, which means
*years are a subjective unit of time*.
For *metric* measures--Python timedeltas analog--this
poses a problem in that years should not be used to represent the span when working
with &.types.Measure.

In order to compensate, the &.types.Month class provides a means to
express such subjective time spans.

[> Unit Aware Comparison ]

Unit subclasses do *not* override the built-in comparison methods implemented by the
&int type that all unit classes are based on. Given that these classes can
represent different units, comparisons *must* be performed with *like units* in order
to yield consistently correct results. In order to compensate, unit aware comparisons are
provided for &.abstract.Point types:
&.abstract.Point.leads and &.abstract.Point.follows.

Measures do not implement unit-aware comparisons and must be converted to like-units
before the integer comparisons may be used.

---------------------------------
[ Math in Python datetime Terms ]
---------------------------------

&..time does not use the usual arithmetic operators for performing datetime
math. Rather, &..time *uses named methods in order to draw a semantic distinction*.
Not to mention, it is sometimes desirable to use the integer's operators directly
in order to avoid semantics involved with representation types.

The list here points to the abstract base classes.
Points *are* timestamps, datetimes,. Measures *are* intervals, timedeltas.

/`timedelta() + timedelta()`/
	&.abstract.Measure.increase:

	#!python
		m1 = types.Measure(second=0)
		m2 = types.Measure(second=1)
		d = m1.increase(m2)

/`timedelta() - timedelta()`/
	&.abstract.Measure.decrease:

	#!python
		m1 = types.Measure(second=2)
		m2 = types.Measure(second=1)
		d = m1.decrease(m2)

/`datetime() + timedelta()`/
	&.abstract.Point.elapse:

	#!python
		ts = types.Timestamp.of(...)
		measure = types.Measure(second=1)
		d = ts.elapse(measure)

/`datetime() - timedelta()`/
	Point in Time subtraction is handled with
	&.abstract.Point.rollback:

	#!python
		ts = types.Timestamp.of()
		measure = types.Measure(second=1)
		d = ts.rollback(measure)

/`datetime() - datetime()`/
	&.abstract.Point.measure:

	#!python
		ts1 = types.Timestamp.of(...)
		ts2 = types.Timestamp.of(...)
		d = ts1.measure(ts2) # measure the distance between

[ Calendar Representation ]
---------------------------

A Date can be used to represent the span of the entire day.

#!python
	date = types.Date.of(year=1982, month=4, day=17)
	assert date.select('day', 'month') == 17

However, the above actually represents.

#!python
	assert date.select('date') == (1982, 5, 18)

Usually, using the `date` keyword is best way to to work with
literal dates.

#!python
	assert types.Date.of(date=(1982,5,18)) == date

The calendrical **representation** only takes effect through certain
interfaces.

#!python
	ts = types.Timestamp.of(iso="2001-01-01T05:30:01")
	print(repr(ts))
	types.Timestamp.of(iso='2001-01-01T05:30:01.000000')

And from a datetime tuple.

#!python
	ts2 = types.Timestamp.of(datetime = (2001, 1, 1, 5, 30, 1, 0))
	assert ts == ts2

&..time PiTs do not perform calendrical validation; rather, fields with excess
values overflow onto larger units. This is similar to how MySQL handles
overflow. For &..time, this choice is deliberate and the user is expected to
perform any desired validation.

#!python
	pit = types.Date.of(date=(1982,5,0))

The assigned `pit` now points to the last day of the month preceding the fifth
month in the year 1982.

-----------------
[ Datetime Math ]
-----------------

&..time can easily answer questions like, "What was third weekend of the fifth
month of last year?".

#!python
	pit = system.utc()
	pit = pit.update('day', 0, 'month') # set to the first day to avoid overflow
	pit = pit.rollback(year=1) # subtract one gregorian year
	pit = pit.update('month', 5-1, 'year') # set to the fifth month
	pit = pit.update('day', 6, 'week') # set to the weekend of the week
	pit = pit.elapse(week = 2)

Things can get a little more interesting when asking about the last weekend
of a given month.

#!python
	# move the beginning of month (to avoid possible day overflow)
	pit = system.utc().update('day', 0, 'month')
	# to the next month and then to the end of the previous
	pit = pit.elapse(month = 1).update('day', -1, 'month') # move to the end of the month.
	# 0 is the beginning of the week, so -1 is the end of the prior week.
	pit = pit.update('day', -1, 'week')

On day overflow, the following illustrates the effect:

#!python
	# working with a leap year
	pit = types.Timestamp.of(iso='2012-01-31T18:55:33.946259')
	pit.elapse(month=1)
	types.Timestamp.of(iso='2012-03-02T18:55:33.946259')

Month arithmetic does not lose days in order to align the edge of a month.
In order to keep overflow from causing invalid calculations, adjust to the
beginning of the month.

Things can get even more interesting when asking,
"What is the second to last Thursday of the month". Questions like this require
alignment in order to be answered:

#!python
	pit = system.utc()
	pit = pit.update('day', 0, 'month') # let's say this month
	# but we need the end of the month
	pit = pit.elapse(month=1)
	pit = pit.update('day', -1, 'month') # set to the first day
	# And now something that will appear almost magical if
	# you haven't used a datetime package with a similar feature.
	pit = pit.update('day', 0, 'week', align=-4) # last thursday of month
	pit = pit.rollback(week=1) # second to last

Essentially, alignment allows Thursdays to be seen as the first day of the
week, warranting that the day field will stay the same or be subtracted when
set to zero. This is why the day is set to the last day of the month, in case
the Thursday is the last day of the month, and with proper alignment the first
day of the re-aligned week.

[ Time Zones ]
--------------

Time zone adjustments are supported by zone objects:

#!python
	pit = system.utc()
	tz = views.Zone.open('America/Los_Angeles')
	local_pit = tz.localize(pit)
	print(local_pit.select('iso'))


[ Constructing Points and Measures ]
====================================

A Point is a Point in Time; like a date or a date and time of day. Usually, this
is referring to instances of the &.types.Timestamp class. A Measure
is an arbitrary unit of time and is usually referring to instances the
&.types.Measure class.

Constructing instances is usually performed with the class method
&.types.Measure.of. Or, &.types.Timestamp.of for Points.

[> Creating a Timestamp ]
-------------------------

The &.types.Timestamp type is the Point In Time Representation
Type with the finest precision available *by default*:

#!python
	near_y2k = types.Timestamp.of(date=(2000,1,1), hour=8, minute=24, second=15)
	>>> near_y2k
	types.Timestamp.of(iso='2000-01-01T08:24:15.000000')

Currently, The &.types.Timestamp and &.types.Measure types use nanosecond precision.

[> Creating a Date ]
--------------------

A Date is also considered a Point In Time type. The Date type exists for the
purpose of representing the point in which the specified day starts, *and* the
period between that point and the start of the next day; non-inclusive:

#!python
	types.Date.of(year=1982, month=4, day=17) # month and day are offsets.
	types.Date.of(iso='1982-05-18')

While a little suprising, the above reveals an apparent inconsistency: the
`month` keyword parameter acts as a month offset. To compensate,
the `date` container keyword parameter is treated specially to accept
gregorian calendar representation. The keyword parameters are literal
increments of units. Subsequently, using the `date` container can more
appropriate:

#!python
	>>> types.Date.of(date=(1982,5,18))
	types.Date.of(iso='1982-05-18')


[> Getting the Current Point in Time ]
--------------------------------------

The primary interface for accessing the system clock is using the
&.system.utc callable:

#!python
	current_time = system.utc()

The returned timestamp is a UTC timestamp.

[> Creating a Timestamp from an ISO-8601 String ]
-------------------------------------------------

While the &.format module manages the details, the
types have access to the functionality:

#!python
	ts = types.Timestamp.of(iso='2009-02-01T3:33:45.123321')

&..time provides parsers for both ISO-8601 and RFC-1123 datetime formats. The
above example shows how to construct a Point in Time from an ISO-8601 string.
The following shows RFC-1123, the format used by HTTP:

#!python
	ts = types.Timestamp.of(rfc='Sun, 19 Mar 2012 07:27:58')

[> Formatting a Standard Timestamp ]
------------------------------------

Likewise, instances can be formatted by the standards:

#!python
	ts = types.Timestamp.of(iso='2009-01-01T7:30:0')
	print(ts.select('iso'))

And RFC as well:

#!python
	assert "Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00" == types.Timestamp(date=(2000,1,1)).select('rfc')

[> Constructing a Timestamp from Parts ]
----------------------------------------

A &.types.Timestamp can be constructed from time parts using the
&.abstract.Time.of class method. This method takes
arbitrary positional parameters and keyword parameters whose keys are the name
of a unit of time known by the time context:

#!python
	ts = types.Timestamp.of(hour = 55, second = 78)

Notably, the above is not particularly useful without a date:

#!python
	types.Timestamp.of(
		date = (2015, 1, 1),
		hour = 13, minute = 7,
		second = 4,
		microsecond = 324159
	)

[> Constructing a Timestamp from a UNIX Timestamp ]
---------------------------------------------------

The `unix` container keyword provides an interface from seconds since the
UNIX-epoch, "January 1, 1970". A timestamp can be made using the
&.abstract.Time.of method:

#!python
	epoch = types.Timestamp.of(unix=0)

Subseqently, a given PiT can yield a UNIX timestamp using the
&.abstract.Time.select method:

#!python
	now = system.utc()
	unix = now.select('unix')

And a contrived use-case where the file `f` contains lines containing unix timestamps:

#!python
	with open(...) as f:
		times = list(map(from_unix, map(int, f.readlines())))

[ Arithmetic of Points and Measures ]
=====================================

Time types are all based on subclasses of Python's &int.
The usual arithmetic operators are essentially low-level operations that can be
used in certain cases, but they should be restricted to performance critical
situations where the higher-level methods cannot be used.

[> Getting a Particular Day of the Week ]
-----------------------------------------

Points and scalars can both update arbitrary fields according to a boundary.
With Timestamps and Dates aligned on the beginning of a week, an arbitrary
day of week can be found by field modification:

#!python
	ts = types.Timestamp.of(iso="2000-01-01T3:30:00")
	>>> print(ts.select('day', 'week'))
	6
	ts = ts.update('day', 1, 'week') # 0-6, Sun-Sat.
	>>> print(ts)
	'1999-12-27T03:30:00.000000'
	>>> print(ts.select('weekday'))
	'monday'

By extension, to get the following Monday, just add seven:

#!python
	ts = types.Timestamp.of(iso="2000-01-01T3:30:00")
	ts = ts.update('day', 8, 'week')
	>>> print(ts)
	'2000-01-03T03:30:00.000000'
	>>> print(ts.select('weekday'))
	'monday'

Or, to get the preceding Monday, just substract seven:

#!python
	>>> ts = types.Timestamp.of(iso="2000-01-01T3:30:00")
	>>> ts = ts.update('day', 1-7, 'week')
	>>> print(ts)
	1999-12-20T03:30:00.000000
	>>> print(ts.select('weekday'))
	monday

And so on: `1+|-14`, `1+|-21`, ...

[> Getting a Particular Weekday of a Month ]
--------------------------------------------

Occasionally, the need may arise to fetch the N-th weekday of the month. This is
trickier than getting an arbitrary weekday as it requires the part to be aligned
on a month. Given an arbitrary time type supporting gregorian units, `ts`, the
month must first be adjusted to the beginning of the month:

#!python
	# Find the third Saturday of the month.
	ts = types.Timestamp.of(...)

	# Get the first of the month.
	ts = ts.update('day', 0, 'month')
	# Now the first Saturday of the month.
	ts = ts.update('day', 6, 'week')
	ts.elapse(day=14)

The above, however, is hiding a factor due to Saturday's nature of being on
the end of the week: alignment. Alignment allows the repositioning of the
boundary that a part is selected from or updated by. This provides the ability
to designate that a particular weekday be the beginning or end of the week.
Subsequently, allowing quick identification:

#!python
	ts = types.Timestamp.of(...)
	# Get the last day of the Month.
	ts = ts.elapse(month=1).update('day', -1, 'month')
	ts.update('day', 0, 'week', align=-2)

===========================
[ Working with Time Zones ]
===========================

Time zones are *difficult* to work with. In the best situations, use is not necessary, but that is,
unfortunately, not often. Time zones offer a rather unique problem as programmers are
indirectly forced into supporting designations often defined by local government. This
imposition complicates the situation dramatically. Even in the case where the right
process is followed, it is possible to come to the wrong conclusion given rotten time zone
information.

There is no easy mode when being time zone aware. It's an extra level of detail that
*must* be managed by the application.

[> Understanding Time Zones ]
-----------------------------

The difficulty of time zones stems from the need to transition to and from an
offset for appropriating the representation of a Point in Time. This is referring to
a couple tasks:

	- Representing a UTC Point in Time in a local form.
	- Converting a local form to a UTC Point in Time.

While this is trivial on the face, the local form is actually a moving target. A
time zone database is maintained by a standards body in order to keep
track of how the local form varies. Often this involves daylight savings time,
but extends into situations where political decisions alter the offsets for a
given region altogether. At a wider scope the database *can* change entirely.
Consider database corrections, updates, or complete substitutions.

This subjective offsetting can create situations where a given time of day
of a local form *is either ambiguous or invalid*. Proper handling of these cases
is often dependent on the context in which a given local form is being used.

When working with zoned PiTs, there are two situations:

	# A canonical Point, normally a PiT in UTC associated with a zone.
	# A local Point where the local form is being represented.

Each situation has its own requirements for proper zone handling.

In the first, the zone identifier should be associated with the PiT object.
These objects should always be a type capable of designating a date and time of
day, the &.types.Timestamp type. Representation types like
&.types.Date don't require zone adjustments unless it
is ultimately intended to refer to the beginning of the day in that particular
zone in UTC.

In the second, the actual offset *and* zone identifier applied to the zone
should be associated with the PiT object.

[> Getting an Offset from a UTC Point in Time ]
-----------------------------------------------

While &.views provides the implementation of Zone objects, high level
access is provided via the &.views.Zone.open class method:

#!python
	tz = views.Zone.open('America/Los_Angeles')
	pit = system.utc()
	offset = tz.find(pit)

Once the &.views.Zone.Offset object has been found for a given point in
time, the UTC point can be adjusted:

#!python
	la_pit = pit.elapse(offset)

[> Localizing a UTC Point in Time ]
-----------------------------------

The examples in the previous section show the details of localization.
&.views.Zone instances have the above functionality packed into a
single method, &.views.Zone.localize:

#!python
	pit, offset = views.Zone.open().localize(system.utc())

The offset applied to the point in time is returned with the adjusted point as it is
often necessary in order to properly represent the timestamp:

#!python
	offset.iso(pit)
	# "2013-01-17T15:36:35.834813000 PST-28800"

[> Normalizing a Local Point in Time ]
--------------------------------------

Normalization is the process of adjusting a localized timestamp by its *known* offset into
a UTC timestamp and then localizing it. The &.views.Zone.normalize
method has this functionality:

#!python
	pit, offset = views.Zone.open().localize(system.utc())
	normalized_pit, new_offset = views.Zone.open().normalize(offset, pit)

Where `normalized_pit` and `new_offset` are the *exact* same objects if no change was
necessary.
