[ Overview ]

&..time is a time library based on the built-in Python &int.
By default, timestamps have nanosecond precision granting common applications
more than enough detail about a point in time. For specialized purposes, the
units handled can be arbitrarily extended--the &int subclasses
represent a designated unit and a common Time Context, group of unit classes,
provides the necessary linkage and transformations for conversion across
classes.

Calendar Support:

	- Proleptic Gregorian

	from fault.time.types import Date, Timestamp, Measure

#!/syntax/python
	from fault.time import sysclock
	now = sysclock.now() # Always UTC
