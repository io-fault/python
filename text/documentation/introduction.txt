[ Introduction ]
================

Eclectic text is a structured text language designed from the syntactic notations
of other popular programming languages, configuration formats, and other markdown
implementations. The rationale for the design is to borrow from one's existing
memory of the notations in order to support new memories with respect to notations
used by eclectic text.

This document is an authoritative specification for the format. Every notation
is used and common exceptions are exercised in order to provide a test suite
for parsers.

[ Defense ]
===========

Eclectic text exists in an effort to create a structured text format that
specifically targets developer APIs for customization of contextual cross-references,
and to focus XML serialization for machine processable data structures.

fault's documentation extractor needed extensive customization in order to support
(relatively) intelligent cross-references and contextual styling of references. While
many, if not all, structured text implementations can support this, most have little or no
documentation on the matter. This makes it difficult for most structured text solutions
to fulfill fault's requirements without extensive modifications that would essentially
be a new implementation.

The name "eclectic text" was chosen as it was indirectly suggested numerous
times over the years.

=========
[ Goals ]
=========

Beyond the basic need of documentation, eclectic text aims to create a text format
that allows the storage of structured document data that can be interpreted as structured
data for configuration files and string template storage.

The structures present in documentation have very clear correspondence to common
data structures. Variable lists being dictionaries, ordered lists being sequences,
and unordered lists being sets.
